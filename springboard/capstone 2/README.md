# Stock price forecasting using LSTM and investment decesion

This reository contains my data-science portfolio including the projects, codes and reports 


In this project, I aim to develop a simple LSTM based model for predicting the upward/downward trend for a stock using historical stock price data and predict future stock price. I would like to identify one or two best stocks per category (retail, tech, oil, consumer, financial, etc.) from the forecast. Then I would tabulate the results and compare it with the analyst estimates from various other sources. The prediction can also be validated using analyst estimates.
